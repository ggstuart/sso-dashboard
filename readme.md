# Documentation for the Student Switch Off dashboard development process

This page is where ECOVISUM will maintain our development priorities for discussion in the Technical Advisory Group meetings.

In preparation for the next meeting (Feb 2018) we have produced a [discussion document](development-options.md) to introduce the feature backlog. Over time we will develop these pages to reflect the evolution of our development priorities and to document the features we add each month.

See [completed features](development-complete.md).
