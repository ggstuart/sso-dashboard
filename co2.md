# CO2 savings display

See: [Aggregate data per university](development-options.md#aggregate-data-per-university), "Potential solutions" No. 2.

Two options to display CO2 savings. These demos are shown on the public large screen, but the "badges" could be displayed anywhere.

## Version 1

(full-screen bottom right)

<video width="700" autoplay controls loop>
  <source src="videos/carbon-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Version 2

(full-screen bottom right)

<video width="700" autoplay controls loop>
  <source src="videos/carbon-02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Feedback so far

Joanna:

- Is it possible to have the little bubbles be more angular shapes (so it’s more on brand)?
- I think it is confusing to have carbon savings in percentages plus also the minus sign is confusing – I think best to go with what you have in the second bubble – the actual amount saved
- Please add aggregate kWhs too

## Related considerations

To make more space for campaign-related features (like the tips) we propose to **remove two existing and probably redundant elements**:

1. the "drop-down" next to the University name where admins can enter a description of their choice. At the last check, only one uni is using this and it is not displayed anywhere
2. the duplicated uni name above the logo, keeping just the uni name that appears within the logo (just as it is shown for each uni on the home page)
