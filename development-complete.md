## Shorter competitions

These changes support the above option, enabling admins to optionally show and hide competitons from the public student view during testing and preparation, or when they are finished.

![competition manager after](images/competition-management-after.png)

Above: the competition manager *showing the new controls*

- competitions can now be published/unpublished in the admin interface
- the main competition cannot be unpublished
- if an unpublished competition becomes main, it is automatically published
- unpublished competitons no longer appear on the public list of competitions
- the main competition icon 'tick' has been replaced by a white trophy icon

### Features pending

([see full details in "Development Options"](development-options.md#shorter-competitions))

- Enable archiving of competitions (as well as publishing/unpublishing) and present archived competitions in a secondary list publicly viewable through an additional click.
- Competitions are (optionally) operated on a rolling basis, operating the leaderboard on recent savings (e.g. the latest 28 days) rather than total cumulative savings.

## Integration with the campaign

Multiple features were suggested, as completed, each is covered below

### Wide-screen display

For each competition there is now a dedicated "full screen" link for showing the competition on large (e.g. plasma) screens. This addresses one of the points listed under this item:

> a wide-screen display with a thin leaderboard alongside a customisable area, possibly with scrolling, customisable messages

![large screen page](images/large-screen-page.png)

Above: the "large screen" link is designed for wide screen sizes

![large screen link](images/iframe-and-full-screen-links.png)

- all competitions now have a dedicated "full screen" page (above)
- there is an automatic "maximum width" limit, in case displays exceed 2000 pixels wide
- the university logo and competition message is displayed alongside the competition
- on larger screens, hall images are no longer cropped into a "letterbox" view
- less cropped hall images mean the iFrame also looks better on wider screens

### Customisable energy-saving tips

> possibly with scrolling, customisable messages

Each university can now manage a series of encouraging energy-saving messages via "tips" in the admin screens. These are visible on the public competition page and the wide-screen display, but omitted from the iframe version as this is designed to show only the leaderboard itself.

![large screen iframe](images/tips.png)

Above: tips appear next to all competitions under the university logo

![large screen page](images/tips-wide-screen.png)

Above: tips on the wide-screen display are in a larger font and cycle automatically

![large screen iframe](images/tips-admin.png)

Above: the new "tips" admin tab is highlighted here, above the university logo

![large screen iframe](images/tips-admin-detail.png)

Above: tips admin screen includes a brief "title" field for easier identification

- you can add, edit and delete any tip from the "tips" admin screen
- tip titles are for admins to help navigate the list of tips e.g. a tip with the admin title "Summer campaign 2018 tip 1" might have a public message encouraging students to "Stay cool - eat more ice-cream!"
- the "home" tab is goneâ€”the university logo now opens the university home page
- the tips cycle through all available tips, and can be paused/played by the user
- tips on the wide-screen version play automatically and the controls are hidden

### Features yet to be prioritised

([see full details in "Integration with the campaign"](development-options.md#integration-with-the-campaign))

- A "podium" style widget showing only the top three
- A single competitor widget showing one hall in a competition
- A summary of the aggregate data for one competition
