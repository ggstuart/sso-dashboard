## Shorter competitions

These changes support the above option, enabling admins to optionally show and hide competitons from the public student view during testing and preparation, or when they are finished.

### Summary of changes

- competitions can now be published/unpublished in the admin interface
- the main competition cannot be unpublished
- if an unpublished competition becomes main, it is automatically published
- unpublished competitons no longer appear on the public list of competitions
- the main competition icon 'tick' has been replaced by a white trophy icon

### Features pending ([see full details in "Development Options"](development-options.md#shorter-competitions))

- Enable archiving of competitions (as well as publishing/unpublishing) and present archived competitions in a secondary list publicly viewable through an additional click.
- Competitions are (optionally) operated on a rolling basis, operating the leaderboard on recent savings (e.g. the latest 28 days) rather than total cumulative savings.
